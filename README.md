# Sonic Code Sessions Berlin
## Jam

This document sets the basics for participants to communicate using the [OSC protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) when taking part in an audio jam between multiple computers.\
We'll also try to provide boilerplate code for different languages so that you can easily connect it with your audio code and join the jam. If your chosen language or framework is missing and you'd like to contribute, please add a new folder - named after the language or framework - containing a file named *template* and submit a pull request.

### Messages - naming scheme and values

##### Using integer values from `0` to `100`:
- `/parameters/tom`

- `/parameters/vladimir`
- `/parameters/dolly`\
*map them to 5 parameters you'd like to expose to your OSC buddies.*

- `/go_cuckoo`\

*map it to a filter of your choice.*
